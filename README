This repo reflects my work for the fulfillment of Free Code Camp's advanced front end development project: Build a JavaScript Calculator.  The following user stories were to be met:

User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
